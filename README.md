Mod development is in progress.

During the Northern Hemisphere winter break in 2026, we will continue actively developing this mod. We are currently discussing and finalizing the core gameplay mechanics. Once all mechanics and gameplay are confirmed, we will move into the full implementation phase as soon as possible.

At the moment, besides the publisher, our team includes one Java developer and one artist. We are still recruiting more members. If you are interested in joining us (paid collaboration is available, and the rate can be negotiated), please feel free to contact us via private message.

Meanwhile, the mod team firmly opposes any form of embryo gene editing. In the mod’s ethics case studies, we will include selected real-world bioethics cases to help raise players’ awareness of responsible research conduct and scientific ethics.
